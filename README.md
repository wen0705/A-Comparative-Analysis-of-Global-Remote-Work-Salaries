# Project2022 -- Data Literacy project

## Datasets:
In this project we mainly use two datasets:
- AI salaries from https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/salaries.csv
- world dataset from geo pandas "naturalearth_lowres"

## Data cleaning:
- world dataset: change the iso3 code of United States Minor Outlyng Islands and American Samoa in USA
- delete the  Singapore's data from salary dataset (Because there is no Singapore in world dataset)
- select the data which occurs both in year 2020 and 2021
- delete the job which do not use AI/ML skills

## Limitation of the dataset
