# Project2022 -- Data Literacy project

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, remote working has already been a "regular"  scenario and more people are being concerned about the salary from working remotely. The report summarizes visual information and analysis results related to the remote salaries. The purpose of this report is to  study regional differences in remote ratio and salaries. We have used choropleth map to investigate the remote working ratio in the context of number of jobs and have done hypothesis test to find out whether there is any significant difference in the average salary.We hope our findings from this report can help the job seekers make better decisions.

## Datasets:
In this project we mainly use two datasets:
- AI salaries from https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/salaries.csv
- world dataset from geo pandas "naturalearth_lowres"
